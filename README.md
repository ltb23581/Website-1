Welcome to my first personal website! This project is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This website serves as my personal space on the internet where I showcase my projects, share my thoughts, and provide information about myself.

Over time, I aspire to use this platform to exhibit my evolution as a student, designer, and engineer, showcasing my personal growth with each new project and endeavor.

You can access my website through this link:
